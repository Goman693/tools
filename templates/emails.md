Loud motherboard fan  
The noise you're hearing is most likely the CPU cooling fan. Unfortunately, this model is known to have rather noisy fans. This can be caused by a buildup of dust near the vent of the device, as well as on the fan itself, or by keeping the computer turned on for extended periods of time.  
You can attempt to clear as much dust out of the system as possible, which may fix it. Keeping your computer off during the night and weekends when you aren't using it may also help it quiet down. However, if it continues and/or gets worse, throw a work order in and I can send the device back to Dell to have them swap out the motherboard/fan for you.
