<h2># enrollment</h2>

<p>
    Registered to another school<br>
    Sent this device to Dell for repairs, Dell replaced the motherboard, and the motherboard was registered
    to another school district. I tried adding the hardware hash to HCPS, contacting the school district to
    delete the
    device from their Enterprise, and looking through Intune groups to delete it out but none of these
    methods
    worked.
    Need a device I can utilize for HCPS Enterprise.<br>
