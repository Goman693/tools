## enrollment

Registered to another school  
Sent this device to Dell for repairs, Dell replaced the motherboard, and the motherboard was registered to another school district. I tried adding the hardware hash to HCPS, contacting the school district to delete the device from their Enterprise, and looking through Intune groups to delete it out but none of these methods worked. Need a device I can utilize for HCPS Enterprise.
