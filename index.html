                Registered to another school<br>
                Sent this device to Dell for repairs, Dell replaced the motherboard, and the motherboard was registered
                to another school district. I tried adding the hardware hash to HCPS, contacting the school district to
                delete the
                device from their Enterprise, and looking through Intune groups to delete it out but none of these
                methods
                worked.
                Need a device I can utilize for HCPS Enterprise.<br>
