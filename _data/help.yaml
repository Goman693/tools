  ## scripts
  When submitting dispatches in Dell TechDirect, there are several issues that come up repeatedly. The purpose of these pages is to make entering these issues much easier by providing a script to use.  

  The first line, in bold, is for the Description of Problem field in TechDirect. The second is for the larger field, Troubleshooting Performed. Some issues have multiple options for the second field for slightly different variants of the same general issue.
  To copy one of these lines to your clipboard for pasting into TechDirect, simply click on it. The line will be momentarily highlighted to show what was copied.

  ## labels
  Creating labels for student laptops can be a pain, requiring Word documents or other templates. This page is designed to simplify the process.
  
  To use it, click on the label you wish to use and type/scan the service tag. More pages can be added or removed with the + and - at the top of the page. When you would like to print the sheet, click the print button at the top right. Make sure to open the More Options dropdown and set the print margins to None, otherwise the labels will not line up with the printed page.

  To create large amounts of labels from a list of service tags (in lieu of a mail merge), paste the list of service tags, separated by line breaks, into the text area on the right.
